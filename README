klick2ardour.py - Apply klick tempo maps to Ardour sessions

http://das.nasophon.de/klick/

klick2ardour.py is a Python script that reads klick tempo maps and
writes them to Ardour session files. It does not create new Ardour
sessions, but replaces all tempo/meter changes and position markers in
existing sessions.

Usage: python klick2ardour.py <tempomap-file> <ardour-session-file>

The session should not be open in Ardour while running this script. And
don't try this on any valuable Ardour session without making a backup
copy beforehand :)
